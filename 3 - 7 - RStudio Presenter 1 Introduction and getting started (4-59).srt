00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,170
Hi, my name is Brian Caffo and, I'm in the
Department of

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,570
Biostatistics at the Bloomberg School of
Public Health at Johns Hopkins University.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,730
And this is the Coursera data science
specialization class on RStudio Presenter.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,630
This class is co-taught with my
instructors, Jeff Leek and Roger Peng.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,040
Okay.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,680
So what is RStudio Presenter?

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,404
Let me get a nice high lighter here.

8
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:26,672
So RStudio created this authoring tool so
that

9
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:31,558
you can create reproducible presentations
within their environment.

10
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:34,054
And basically if you're familiar with
slidify, then,

11
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:36,230
you should have zero effort for picking
this up.

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,370
And if you're not familiar with slidify, I
think

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,980
this is probably a little bit easier to
learn.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,708
So, just like Slidify code is author,
authored in a

15
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:47,450
generalized mark down format that allows
for R code chunks.

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,310
And the ultimate output is an html5

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,680
presentation that you view in a web
browser.

18
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:56,306
The file index for the presenter file is,
has

19
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:01,501
a .Rpres extension instead of .md .r mark
down Extension

20
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:04,192
like and slidify and then there's a lot of

21
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:06,883
GUI tools, and we will go through them in,
the

22
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,919
environment that you can use that makes,
you know,

23
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,610
this quite nice, if you like to use GUI
tools,

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,749
and maybe if you like to do a lot of

25
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:18,200
command lines stuff maybe slidify would be
better for you.

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,020
Okay.

27
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:28,290
So the guide that you probably want to
follow is, on this link right here.

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,660
Go to that guide, it's, very good.

29
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,966
Most of this content is just taken from
that link and I, created this

30
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:38,866
presentation in, RStudio Presenter so you
could get a sense what it looks like.

31
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:43,696
The Quick start is just you do File, and
then New File then R presentation and if

32
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:49,252
you're you know, keystroke junkie, then
that's just Alt-f, then f, then p.

33
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:51,124
And then you just start using

34
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:54,530
Slidify/knitr style Cmd for authoring
content.

35
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,210
They walk you through they, they have all

36
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,739
these things that will help walk you
through it.

37
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,810
You know, so, single quotes for inline
code.

38
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,580
Triple quotes for block code.

39
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,880
And, same options as, you know, for code
evaluation catch.

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,270
Okay.

41
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,330
So here's my, presentation that I was
working on, for today.

42
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,310
And, you can see here in the preview pane
here.

43
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,715
Here's the The preview what I could, do,
is if I wanted to,

44
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:27,000
I could pop this whole thing out into a
oh, where am I at?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,860
There we go, into a bigger

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,730
bigger screen.

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,898
If you, click on this button over here
more, it'll, show that you can

48
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:42,119
view it in the browser, you can save it as
a web page, you can publish it to RPubs.

49
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:46,724
This clears the cache, from the R Code
that you ran.

50
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:48,940
and, you know, this navigates through.

51
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,550
Then, if you're at a slide that you want,
and you click on Edit.

52
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,580
It brings you to that, location in the
slide over there.

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,190
okay, so let's just show you how to, how
to get started.

54
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,855
So you would just go to File > New File.

55
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:05,410
New file > R Presentation.

56
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,770
And then it, it creates one.

57
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,774
And I'll just create one called [SOUND]
test.

58
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,086
Okay.

59
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:14,770
There it is.

60
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,850
Okay.

61
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:23,085
And so now, if I say this is my, my test
presentation.

62
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:26,340
[SOUND] Brian Caffo [SOUND] and the date
is, I

63
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,121
don't know let's just put the R date in
there.

64
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:33,055
So we'll just do date [SOUND] like that.

65
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:33,977
Okay.

66
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:36,600
And then when I save it, watch what
happens.

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,690
It compiles it, my test presentation,
Brian Caffo, puts the date in there.

68
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:40,800
Okay.

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,280
Then you can see how the, authoring looks
an awful lot like just ordinary old.

70
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
Mark down or Slidify like we've done
before.

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:59,200
You can see right here, where you have
some separated out R code.

72
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,246
So look, it'll look like that where it

73
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,680
reproduces the code and then puts it in
there.

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,290
You know, and of course it takes the same
subset of commands as Knitter and Slidify.

75
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,980
So if I did echo equals false.

76
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,347
Right, and then save it, it reruns it, and

77
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:18,034
there now, it's no longer, echoing the,
Cmd, okay?

78
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:20,047
And then, it shows you how you can, add

79
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:22,740
in plots, and that sort of, that's sort of
thing.

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,667
So during this presentation what I'm just
going to

81
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,910
go through, is all the options you can go.

82
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,950
These, these equal signs separate the
slides.

83
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,990
You actually only need three of them,
right?

84
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,360
So if I do that, it, gives me that.

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,151
But I take away down to two, it messes up,
right?

86
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:42,680
Okay, so, you need three of them.

87
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,958
And it gives the correct, correct slide
transition.

88
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,856
Okay, but, another, and, so it's a, and
